# Testing

## Automated testing in JavaScript

Some functions in React - including Reducers - are just plain JavaScript functions and can be tested like any other function.

See the presentation [JavaScript Testing](./javascript-testing-en.html) for an overview (note: the library Jest is already set up in a create-react-app project)

## Testing React components

what to test:

- rendering
- reacting to user actions

## Test renderers for React

- **react-testing-library**
- _react-test-renderer_ (developed by the React team)
- _Enzyme_

## Snapshot Tests

Components are rendered and compared to earlier versions (snapshots)
