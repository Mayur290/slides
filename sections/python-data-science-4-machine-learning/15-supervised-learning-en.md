# Supervised learning

## Supervised learning procedure

steps:

- collect and prepare training data (input data and associated output data)
- train an algorithm based on the input and output (can take time)
- validate the algorithm's accuracy
- use the algorithm to predict outputs for new data

## Algorithms for supervised learning

Classification:

- _neural networks_
- k-nearest-neighbors
- logistic regression
- naive Bayes
- support vector machines
- decision trees and random forests

Regression:

- _neural networks_
- linear regression
- polynomial regression
